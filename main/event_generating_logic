Writing events:

	- Creating group
		+ Group name
		+ Permission public / private
	- Creating event:
	 	+ Name
	 	+ Date
	 	+ Start
	 	+ End

Reading events:
	- All of users event will be loaded in the background, although 
	  for the current screen/week, we will filter with time
	  to have events for that week only.

	- Generating event
		+ Event is put in columns according to their day of the week
		+ Length of event is 75px / hour
		+ Position of event on the column is determined by offset (top: ? px) based of starting time of the event
		  for example: event start at 0 am have no offset, while at 2 am have 75 * 2 = 150 offset top
		+ Width of event: an comparing operation is done between all events in one day
		  Then e.g. only 1 event during 1 period of time: use class event-full
		  				 2 event during 2 period of time: use class event-half
		  				 3 event during 3 period of time: use class event-third and this is the maximum
		  A callback should be made while creating event to prevent > 3 events during 1 period of time.


	- To generate event, these information are need
	    + Date
	    + When the event starts
	    + When it ends
	    + To which group in belongs


	- For a different user, just request the database, and use the same process
